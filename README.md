Spawn Timer
=============================================================
Based on [Portal Timer](https://github.com/felixb/portal-timer)
I felt that this was a large enough change to make it worth a new repo, and the amount of git diffs after updating to the new SDKs wasn't worth merging.

What is this thing?
------------------------------------------------------------
It's a timer that sits in the notification tray, it's primarily targeted at Pokemon Go or Ingress players, but should work for anything repetetive you want to time.

Planned and completed functionality:
------------------------------------------------------------
- [x] Support for Pokemon Go
- [x] Mostly material design.. I'll possibly look into notification actions 
- [ ] Optimize depricated code
- [ ] Optimize timer
